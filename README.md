### For this homework assignment, you will need the following libraries: 
library(tidyverse)
library(rvest)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(tidytext)
library(knitr)
library(geonames)
library(gapminder)
library(countrycode)

### Overview of the assignment: 

This assignment entailed me collecting two data sets from the internet and analyzing them. The gapminder.Rmd document sees me use an API to download information from GeomNames.org about the geographic size of each country and then join it to the gapminder data to update a graph which compares life expectancy to population data. The letterboxd.Rmd document sees me scrape text from all the reviews I have left on Letterboxd (a movie social networking site) and then conduct a word frequency and sentiment analysis upon them. Turns out I like movies! I am so surprised.
